# üè¶ Corrected: Centralized Service Recording & Cross-Organizational Data Sharing System

## üéØ **What This System Really Does**

This is a **centralized service recording system** where:
- **All organizations** (banks, courts, police, telecoms) record services they provide to citizens
- **All organizations** can view relevant service records when scanning a citizen's fingerprint
- **Cross-organizational decision making** based on shared service history

---

## üîÑ **Complete Service Recording Flow**

### **Step 1: Citizen Approaches Any Organization**
```
üë§ Kwame approaches Ghana Commercial Bank for a loan
```

### **Step 2: Agent Scans Citizen's Fingerprint**
```java
// Bank agent scans Kwame's fingerprint
POST /api/agent/biometric/scan
{
  "agentId": "GCB_AGENT_001",
  "scannerId": "FP_SCANNER_001",
  "purpose": "SERVICE_LOOKUP",
  "organizationType": "BANK"
}

// System processes fingerprint and returns citizen profile
Response: {
  "citizenFound": true,
  "citizenId": "CIT_001",
  "basicInfo": {
    "name": "Kwame Asante",
    "phone": "+233244567890",
    "kycStatus": "VERIFIED"
  },
  "existingServices": {
    "hasServices": true,
    "serviceCount": 3,
    "needsConsent": true
  }
}
```

### **Step 3: Request Consent to View Service History**
```java
// System requests citizen consent to view their service records
POST /api/consent/request
{
  "citizenId": "CIT_001",
  "requestingAgent": "GCB_AGENT_001",
  "organizationType": "BANK", 
  "dataRequested": [
    "EXISTING_LOANS",
    "CREDIT_HISTORY", 
    "CRIMINAL_RECORDS",
    "TRAFFIC_VIOLATIONS",
    "COURT_CASES"
  ],
  "purpose": "LOAN_ASSESSMENT"
}

// Citizen provides consent (via mobile app or verbal confirmation)
Response: {
  "consentGranted": true,
  "accessibleData": [
    "EXISTING_LOANS",
    "CREDIT_HISTORY",
    "CRIMINAL_RECORDS", 
    "TRAFFIC_VIOLATIONS"
  ],
  "accessDuration": "30 minutes"
}
```

### **Step 4: View Citizen's Complete Service History**
```java
// Agent views citizen's cross-organizational service records
GET /api/services/citizen/CIT_001/history
{
  "bankingServices": [
    {
      "organizationId": "RURAL_BANK_002",
      "serviceType": "MICRO_LOAN",
      "amount": 5000.00,
      "status": "ACTIVE",
      "paymentHistory": "GOOD",
      "addedDate": "2023-08-15",
      "addedBy": "RB_AGENT_005"
    }
  ],
  "courtRecords": [
    {
      "organizationId": "ACCRA_COURT_001", 
      "recordType": "CIVIL_CASE",
      "caseNumber": "CIVIL_2023_001",
      "status": "RESOLVED",
      "addedDate": "2023-06-10",
      "addedBy": "COURT_CLERK_003"
    }
  ],
  "policeRecords": [
    {
      "organizationId": "ACCRA_POLICE_001",
      "recordType": "TRAFFIC_FINE",
      "amount": 200.00,
      "status": "PAID",
      "points": 2,
      "addedDate": "2024-01-05",
      "addedBy": "OFFICER_007"
    }
  ],
  "creditScore": 720,
  "riskLevel": "LOW"
}
```

### **Step 5: Organization Makes Decision Based on Complete History**
```java
// Bank agent decides to approve loan based on good history
// Agent records the new service they're providing
POST /api/services/add
{
  "citizenId": "CIT_001",
  "organizationId": "GCB_001",
  "serviceType": "PERSONAL_LOAN",
  "serviceData": {
    "loanAmount": 25000.00,
    "interestRate": 8.5,
    "termMonths": 24,
    "collateral": "VEHICLE_TITLE",
    "approvalReason": "Good credit history, stable income"
  },
  "agentId": "GCB_AGENT_001",
  "approvalDate": "2024-01-15T14:30:00Z"
}

// System records this new service in citizen's permanent record
Response: {
  "serviceId": "SRV_GCB_001",
  "status": "RECORDED",
  "visibleToOrganizations": [
    "ALL_BANKS",
    "CREDIT_BUREAUS", 
    "GOVERNMENT_AGENCIES"
  ]
}
```
