# Security Architecture

## Overview
The security architecture implements defense-in-depth principles with multiple layers of protection.

## Security Layers
1. **Network Security**: HTTPS, firewall rules
2. **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
3. **Authorization**: Role-based access control
4. **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit
5. **Audit**: Comprehensive audit logging

## Authentication Flow
1. User submits credentials
2. System validates credentials
3. JWT token is generated and returned
4. Token is used for subsequent requests
5. Token is validated on each request

## Authorization Model
- **Super Admin**: Full system access
- **Department Admin**: Department-specific access
- **Officers**: Operational access
- **Citizens**: Limited self-service access

## Data Protection
- Sensitive data is encrypted
- PII is masked in logs
- Database connections are encrypted
- API communications use HTTPS
